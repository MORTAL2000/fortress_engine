* Things to do...

This is just to keep track of possible things to do in the future, none of these are necessarily "planned features" (despite the file name).

*** File modifications
- Remove old commented-out code
- Change names of project in files or remove headers/footers entirely

*** Project Structure
- Files are all in one /src folder rn
  - Would be nice to organize them a bit more somehow
  - Would be nice to move them into completely seperate namespaces somehow too

*** Building
- Bundle a version of all depencendies
  - (Or don't because some are like, hundreds of megabytes)
    - Could use LFS for that I guess

*** Project 
- TravisCI or something?
- Tests?

*** Contributing
- Set a coding style

*** Documentation
- Add logging library
- Add doxygen?
