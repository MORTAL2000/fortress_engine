* Things to do...

This is just to keep track of possible things to do in the future, none of these are necessarily "planned features" (despite the file name).

*** Enhancements
- Remove old commented-out code
- Change names of project in files or remove headers/footers entirely
- Some type of GUI?
- Debugging!
  - I'm currently having trouble making sense of rotations
  - Would be useful to have debug visualizations for entities
  - Show variables in their components, visualize the ones that make sense
  - Use IMGUI for debug GUIs
  - Edit their variables directly???
  	- This is like on-the-way-to an actual Game Engine I suppose

*** Project Structure
- Files are all in one /src folder rn
  - Would be nice to organize them a bit more somehow
  - Would be nice to move them into completely seperate namespaces somehow too

*** Building
- Bundle a version of all depencendies
  - (Or don't because some are like, hundreds of megabytes)
    - Could use LFS for that I guess

*** Project Management
- TravisCI or something?
- Tests?

*** Contributing
- Set a coding style

*** Documentation
- Add logging library
- Add doxygen?
